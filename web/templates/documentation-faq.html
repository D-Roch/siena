<dl>
	<dt><strong>Is siena another ORM?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Not exactly. It is not an ORM (Object-relational mapping tool) because it is not
		only intended to be used in relational databases. Siena is a library for persistience
		that works in relational databases and NoSQL databases as well.</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>Does siena support JOINs?</strong></dt>
	<dd>No. Siena has a common API for both relational and NoSQL databases. So you can
		write code for NoSQL databases and then port it to a relational database and viceversa.
		Supporting JOINs will break this compatibility. <br/>
		Instead of using JOINs you can use denormalization. Siena has some features that will
		help you with this. Please read the <a href="/documentation-getting-started.html">Getting started guide</a>,
		the section that talks about "embedded objects".
	</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>How can I implement one-to-many relationships?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Check the <a href="/documentation-getting-started.html">Getting started guide</a>,
		the section that talks about "Working with relationships".</dd>
	
	
	<dt><strong>How can I implement many-to-many relationships?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Just create an intermediate class that represents the many-to-many relationship.
		Then implement two one-to-many relationships. Check the
		<a href="/documentation-getting-started.html">Getting started guide</a>,
		the section that talks about "Working with relationships".</dd>
	
	<dt><strong>Does Siena support foreign keys?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Siena supports relationships and can work in relational databases. But ensuring
		data consistency depends on your database engine. In relational databases
		you can create your constraints manually. The <a href="/documentation-jdbc.html">siena implementation
		for relational databases</a> can create the database schema, but doesn't support
		creating the foreign keys yet.</dd>

	<dt><strong>Can siena create and update the database schema?</strong></dt>
	<dd>The <a href="/documentation-jdbc.html">siena implementation
		for relational databases</a> can generate the SQL needed to keep in sync
		your data model with your database schema. It creates "CREATE TABLE" and "ALTER TABLE", etc.
		when needed.</dd>


	<dt><strong>Does siena support connection pooling?</strong></dt>
	<dd>The <a href="/documentation-jdbc.html">siena implementation
		for relational databases</a> supports pluggable <code>siena.jdbc.ConnectionManager</code>.
		You can implement your own. If you are using the Play! framework the best idea is to
		implement a ConnectionManager that uses the pooling feature from the framework.
